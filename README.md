The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.

    Usage: push <int>
        where <int> is an integer
    if <int> is not an integer or if there is no argument given to push, print the error message L<line_number>: usage: push integer, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
        where is the line number in the file
    You won’t have to deal with overflows. Use the atoi function

    The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
        The top element of the stack contains the result
        The stack is one element shorter



7. Implement the div opcode.

The div opcode

The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

    Usage: div
    If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't div, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
    The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
        The top element of the stack contains the result
        The stack is one element shorter
    If the top element of the stack is 0, print the error message L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE




8. Implement the mul opcode.

The mul opcode

The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

    Usage: mul
    If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't mul, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
    The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
        The top element of the stack contains the result
        The stack is one element shorter



9. Implement the mod opcode.

The mod opcode

The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

    Usage: mod
    If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't mod, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
    The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
        The top element of the stack contains the result
        The stack is one element shorter
    If the top element of the stack is 0, print the error message L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE




10. Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).



Implement the pchar opcode.

The pchar opcode

The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

    Usage: pchar
    The integer stored at the top of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
    If the value is not in the ascii table (man ascii) print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, value out of range, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
    If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE




11. Implement the pchar opcode.

The pchar opcode

The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

    Usage: pchar
    The integer stored at the top of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
    If the value is not in the ascii table (man ascii) print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, value out of range, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
    If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE




12. Implement the pstr opcode.

The pstr opcode

The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

    Usage: pstr
    The integer stored in each element of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
    The string stops when either:
        the stack is over
        the value of the element is 0
        the value of the element is not in the ascii table
    If the stack is empty, print only a new line



13. Implement the rotl opcode.

The rotl opcode

The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.

    Usage: rotl
    The top element of the stack becomes the last one, and the second top element of the stack becomes the first one
    rotl never fails



14. Implement the rotr opcode.

The rotr opcode

The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.

    Usage: rotr
    The last element of the stack becomes the top element of the stack
    rotr never fails



15. Implement the stack and queue opcodes.

The stack opcode

The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program.

    Usage: stack

The queue opcode

The opcode queue sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).

    Usage: queue

When switching mode:

    The top of the stack becomes the front of the queue
    The front of the queue becomes the top of the stack



16. Write a Brainf*ck script that prints School, followed by a new line.

    All your Brainf*ck files should be stored inside the bf sub directory
    You can install the bf interpreter to test your code: sudo apt-get install bf

17. Add two digits given by the user.

    Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result
    The total of the two digits with be one digit-long (<10)



18. Multiply two digits given by the user.

    Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result
    The result of the multiplication will be one digit-long (<10)


20. Multiply two digits given by the user. Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result, followed by a new line
